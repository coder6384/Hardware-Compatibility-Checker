    <h1 class=text-primary>Learn more on computers</h1>
    <p class=text-light>
        It is oftenly difficult for people owning computers to actually know what parts are compatible with their
        computers whether they are intending to repair, upgrade or assemble their own computers.Bringing the need to
        explain
        common computer hardware parts that most likely you will find yourself in need of purchase</p>
    <h1 class=text-light>Storage</h1>
    <p class=text-light>Computers have similar ways of storing their data but the difference comes to how the storage
        location
        looks like when seen there are the common types known as the Hard Disk Drive or HDD and there is also the solid
        state drive.
    </p>
    <h3 class=text-light>(a) HDDs </h3>
    <p class=text-light>HDDs come in various types the modern most common one is the SATA found in many computers that
        have a
        hard disk drive.It is made up of two spinning disks that have been magnetized, when data is being read from them
        a sound can be heard, this comes from the head of the hard disk that moves along its arm's reach as it reads and
        inputs data
        .It comes at a cheaper price and it is relatively slower than SDDs compapred to the SDD that is why it is mostly
        preffered by the people who want
        more storage but compromise on performance</p>
    <h3 class=text-light>(b) sDDs </h3>
    <p class=text-light>SDDs lack spining disks like the HDDs but have memory chips inside them, they have been used
        in
        phones for the longest
        time, but are now becoming common in desktops and laptops.They are more durable since they have less moving
        parts.The lack of moving parts
        is what makes the SDD costly and also fast</P>
    <h1 class=text-light>RAM</h1>
    <p class=text-light>The random Access Memory has various versions depending on how old the computer is or what
        version your motherboard
        supports, these versions include DDR, DDR2, DDR3 and DDR4, the later the generation the faster the ram speed in
        general but
        each versions also have their own individual clocking speed ranging of upto 4.0ghz found mostly in the DDR4 RAM
        version.
        Each compueter motherboard has a particular number of slots its can accommodate ranging from two to four
        slots.That being
        said, each motherboard has a limit to how much RAM it can have not doing so might relsult in slowing down of
        your computer
    </p>
    <h1 class=text-light>CPU</h1>
    <p class=text-light>Even though computer hardware has changed visually over the past couple of years CPU chips
        havent changed
        much in the last ten years, There are currently only two major ompanies that manufacture CPUs; Intel and AMD.
        They all
        have their own versions that upgrade not necessariy over time but interms of efficiency. They do this inorder to
        make
        modern CPUs that are effciently and relatively affordable.CPUs are mostly sold depending on the task they
        accomplish.
        Cheaper ones are made for computers made for light use and the more expensive ones are uselful in heavy tasks
        such as gamin, video editing
        and handling other heavy software.These speeds are measured in clocks the slower ones being at 0.5GHz to the
        faster ones at 5.0ghz, their efficiency is also measured in
        cores which is basically one CPU divided into various portions from 1 known as dual core, 2 core CPUs are known
        as dual cores, 4- quad core, 8 octacore and 10-decacore.
        The increase in the number of cores also results in the increase of the maximum number of threads it can handle
